# _My Natal Chart_

Below, you can see the 7 main planets, but the sign they are in is based off of the moment I was born on December 27th, 2001 at 3:15 PM.

Every planets tranistions through the constellation correlating to the signs, each transition at their own length. Saturn takes the longest of the main 7 to transition through each sign, about 3 years each, while the moon is the shortest, only taking about 2 days.
I used [AstroChart](https://astro-charts.com/) to pull up my natal chart, click here to enter yours as well!

As you can see, I have a lot of placements, or planets, in the sign of Capricorn, including sun, venus, and mercury. Then I have two Gemini placements in the moon and saturn. Finally, one Pisces placement in mars and one Cancer placement in jupiter.

  * As a Capricorn sun, **my core values revolve around my ambition and my ability to calculate my next move.**
  * As a Capricorn venus, **stability and devotion are important to me when it comes to my relationships.**
  * As a Capricorn mercury, **I rarely ramble, I communicate percisely, cutting out details.**
  * As a Gemini moon, **I am intellectual, and quickly move through emotions, and my emotions tend to be convoluted.**
  * As a Pisces Mars, **I am motivated by my creativity, and I have a tendency to escape through art or video games to release stress.**
  * With Saturn in Gemini, **I have more limitations in terms of communication and I work hard to get my point across.**
  * With Jupiter in Cancer, **I experience more sensitivity and empathy to those around me.**
