# _My Natal Chart_

Below, you can see the 7 main planets, but the sign they are in is based off of the moment I was born on December 27th, 2001 at 3:15 PM.

Every planets tranistions through the constellation correlating to the signs, each transition at their own length. Saturn takes the longest of the main 7 to transition through each sign, about 3 years each, while the moon is the shortest, only taking about 2 days.

As you can see, I have a lot of placements, or planets, in the sign of Capricorn, including sun, venus, and mercury.
