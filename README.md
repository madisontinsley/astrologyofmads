astrology was my pandemic hobby when there was little else to do.
i have frequently been told it is ridiculous and unbelievable, but honestly...

the amount of entertainment value you get _**for free**_.

so, today i am going to take a jounrey through my natal chart, an astrological snapshot of the moment i was born on december 27th, 2001 at 3:15 PM.

and, a little introduction to the ideas in astrology, which is way more than just the typical sun sign.

**please feel free to have fun with this, you do not have to be a believer and i am not asking you to be!**

below are three introduction pages, then a short analysis of my own birth chart:
