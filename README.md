Astrology was my pandemic hobby when there was little else to do.
I have frequently been told it is ridiculous and unbelievable, but honestly...

The amount of entertainment value you get _**for free**_.

So, today I am going to take a journey through my natal chart, an astrological snapshot of the moment I was born on December 27th, 2001 at 3:15 PM.

And, a little introduction to the ideas in astrology, which is way more than just the typical sun sign.

Below are two introduction pages, then a short analysis of my own birth chart:
